# Remote Retreat
## OSINT

### Description:
>Agent, it's good to have you. One of our targets has been constantly avoiding us, but we managed to find their private Instagram. They just posted a photo, but we can't work out where they are. We tried to check the EXIF data, but it appears the social platform removes it automatically. Let us know where he is by clicking on the map, you'll have to be accurate to within 500 meters!

### Overview: 
Since it is an OSINT challenge, zoomin in on the image reveals the name of the the place the photo was taken at.
The place is `the HAKA bar`.
Searching for this place on google mapstells us that it is  a Bar and Restaurant in Morzine, France.
Copy and paste the google maps link into thw challenge map.
